class MultiHeadAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    """Compute Multi-Head [1]_ (masked) self- or cross- attention layer.

    An attention class that runs through an attention mechanism (i.e. most commonly scaled dot-product) several
    times in parallel. The independent attention outputs are then concatenated and linearly transformed into the
    expected dimension.

    This class implements a multi-head attention layer to be used in a Transformer model. The layer
    computes self-attention using dot-product attention, and applies linear transformations
    to the queries, keys, and values to project them into different subspaces. The resulting
    attention scores are then combined and transformed to produce the final output.

    The multi-head attention layer allows the model to attend to different positions and contexts
    in the input sequence, and to combine and weight these contexts in different ways to produce
    the final output. This can help the model to better capture long-range dependencies and
    complex patterns in the input data.

    The multi-head attention layer is composed of several attention heads, each of which
    computes an attention score for a subset of the queries, keys, and values. The attention
    scores are then combined and weighted to produce the final output for each attention head,
    and the outputs of the attention heads are concatenated and transformed to produce the
    final output of the layer.

    The layer can optionally use a window mask to prevent attention between elements that are
    too far apart in the input sequence. This can help the model to focus on local contexts and
    avoid attending to irrelevant positions in the input.

    Notes
    -----
    Intuitively, multiple attention heads allows for attending to parts of the sequence differently
    (e.g. longer-term dependencies versus shorter-term dependencies).

    Mathematical equations
    ---------------------

    The multi-head attention mechanism computes the attention scores between the queries and key-value pairs using the dot product of their representations. The attention scores are then combined and transformed to produce the final output:

    .. math::
        Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V

    Where:

    - :math:`Q` is the queries tensor, with shape (batch_size, no. of queries, depth)
    - :math:`K` is the keys tensor, with shape (batch_size, no. of key-value pairs, depth)
    - :math:`V` is the values tensor, with shape (batch_size, no. of key-value pairs, depth)
    - :math:`d_k` is the depth of the queries and keys
    - :math:`softmax` is the softmax function

    The final output of the multi-head attention is computed as a weighted sum of the transformed queries, keys, and values, with the attention scores as the weights:

    .. math::
        Output = Concat(head_1, \\dots, head_n)W^O

    Where:

    - :math:`head_i` is the output of the $i$-th attention head, with shape (batch_size, no. of queries, depth / num_heads)
    .. math::
        head_i = Attention(Q W^Q_i, K W^K_i, V W^V_i)
    - :math:`Concat` is the concatenation operation
    - :math:`W^O` is the linear transformation matrix, with shape (num_heads * depth, depth)

    The attention weights tensor is optional and can be used to visualize and analyze the attention mechanisms in the model. The attention weights tensor has shape (batch_size, no. of queries, no. of key-value pairs).

    Parameters
    ----------
    d_model : int
        The dimension of the model, i.e., the depth of the input and output tensors.
    num_heads : int
        Number of the heads in the multi-head attention
    dropout_rate : float
        The dropout rate to use for regularization. Float between 0 and 1.
    bias : bool, optional
        Whether to use bias terms in the linear transformations i.e. W_q, W_k, W_v, and W_o, by default False.

    Returns
    -------
    output:
        Concatenated tensors

    split_heads(X)

            This method computes the multi-head attention for the given queries, keys, and values,

            in the constructor. The attention scores are then combined and transformed to produce

            The window mask tensor, by default None. This tensor has shape
            (batch_size, no. of queries, no. of key-value pairs) and contains zeros

        Returns
        -------
